# This file contains the preferences for the concretizer:
# - We disable reuse of build cache products during concretization
#   (but build cache products will get used if available during install).
# - We want unified environments that can be installed in a simple view,
#   but unfortunately that prevents multiple geometry versions. We use
#   when_possible in those containers where multiple geometry versions are
#   installed, and consider other duplicate packages an error.
